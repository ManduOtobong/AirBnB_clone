0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

cmd — Support for line-oriented command interpreters
Source code: Lib/cmd.py

The Cmd class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

class cmd.Cmd(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)
A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter framework. There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather, it’s useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order to inherit Cmd’s methods and encapsulate action methods.

The optional argument completekey is the readline name of a completion key; it defaults to Tab. If completekey is not None and readline is available, command completion is done automatically.

The optional arguments stdin and stdout specify the input and output file objects that the Cmd instance or subclass instance will use for input and output. If not specified, they will default to sys.stdin and sys.stdout.

Cmd Example
The cmd module is mainly useful for building custom shells that let a user work with a program interactively.

This section presents a simple example of how to build a shell around a few of the commands in the turtle module.

Basic turtle commands such as forward() are added to a Cmd subclass with method named do_forward(). The argument is converted to a number and dispatched to the turtle module. The docstring is used in the help utility provided by the shell.

The example also includes a basic record and playback facility implemented with the precmd() method which is responsible for converting the input to lowercase and writing the commands to a file. The do_playback() method reads the file and adds the recorded commands to the cmdqueue for immediate playback:

import cmd, sys
from turtle import *

class TurtleShell(cmd.Cmd):
    intro = 'Welcome to the turtle shell.   Type help or ? to list commands.\n'
    prompt = '(turtle) '
    file = None

        'Move the turtle forward by the specified distance:  FORWARD 10'
